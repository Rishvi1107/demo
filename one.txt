3. Obstacles
Quick and Anonymous Transactions:

Computer transactions happen rapidly and can be conducted from anywhere.
These transactions often involve encryption, making it difficult to trace the individuals involved.
Lack of Identifying Traits:

Unlike traditional methods like handwriting or signatures, computer transactions lack tangible traits for identifying the responsible individuals.
Ephemeral Paper Trails:

Any paper trail left by computer records is ephemeral and can be quickly altered or removed.
Automatic Erasure by Auditing Tools:

After computer transactions are completed, auditing tools may automatically erase the corresponding digital evidence.
Simplicity of Data Alteration:

The ease with which data can be altered and transactions conducted anonymously adds to the complexity of electronic crime investigations.
Challenges in Investigation:

Investigating electronic crimes is inherently challenging due to the factors mentioned above.
Adherence to Norms:

Despite these challenges, investigators aim to follow established norms for evidence collection and remain diligent in their efforts to gather information.
